Workflow Explanation
1. Planning and Setup
Start by defining your project goals, creating a repository on GitHub, and setting up your local environment with git init. This prepares your workspace for version control.

2. Creating a Branch
Create a new branch from the main branch to work on a specific feature or fix. This allows you to develop without affecting the stable version of your project.

3. Development & Committing Changes
Make changes in your codebase, then stage (git add) and commit (git commit) these changes with descriptive messages. This records your progress and helps keep track of updates.

4. Pushing to Remote Repository
Push your branch to GitHub with git push, so your work is stored remotely and accessible for collaboration or backup.

5. Pull Request & Review
Open a pull request on GitHub to review the new changes. Team members can discuss, suggest modifications, or approve the updates.

6. Merging & Deployment
Once approved, merge the branch into the main branch. Deploy the updated code to production or make it live.

7. Cleanup & Repeat
Delete feature branches if necessary and repeat the process for new features or fixes, maintaining a clean project history.

Summary
This workflow ensures organized, collaborative, and efficient project development. Using branches allows multiple features to be developed simultaneously without conflicts, and pull requests facilitate code review and quality control before merging changes into the main project.
