Basic GitHub Project Workflow
1. Initialize a Repository
Create a new directory and initialize Git:

CopyRun
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
(Add explain: This sets up a new local Git repository)

2. Create Files and Make Initial Commit
Create your project files (e.g., index.html, styles.css, etc.), then add and commit:

CopyRun
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: set up project structure"
(Add explain: Adds all files and commits with a message)

3. Create a New Branch for Development
CopyRun
git branch feature-branch
git checkout feature-branch
(Add explain: Creates and switches to a feature branch to work on new features)

4. Make Changes and Commit
Edit files, then stage and commit changes:

CopyRun
git add modified_file.js
git commit -m "Add new feature to JavaScript file"
(Add explain: Tracks changes and commits them)

5. Push Changes to Remote Repository
First, connect to GitHub:

CopyRun
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
Then push your branch:

CopyRun
git push -u origin feature-branch
(Add explain: Uploads your branch to GitHub)

6. Create a Pull Request (PR)
Go to GitHub website, open your repository, and create a PR from feature-branch to main. Discuss, review, and merge.

(Add explain: Collaboration step to review code before merging)

7. Merge Branch into Main
Once approved, merge via GitHub UI or on your local:

CopyRun
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
git push origin main
(Add explain: Updates main branch with your feature)

8. Delete Feature Branch (Optional)
CopyRun
git branch -d feature-branch
git push origin --delete feature-branch
(Add explain: Cleans up branches after merging)

Summary
This workflow helps manage project development with version control:

Initialize repo
Create branches for features
Commit and push changes
Use pull requests for review
Merge into main branch
Collaborate efficiently
